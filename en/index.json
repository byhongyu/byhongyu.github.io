Enough said â€” see the Twelve Factor App principles on this point.

If you look at the stub script in src/data/make_dataset.py, it uses a package called python-dotenv to load up all the entries in this file as environment variables so they are accessible with os.environ.get. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example snippet adapted from the python-dotenv documentation:\n# src/data/dotenv_example.py\rimport os\rfrom dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv\r# find .env automagically by walking up directories until it's found\rdotenv_path = find_dotenv()\r# load up the entries as environment variables\rload_dotenv(dotenv_path)\rdatabase_url = os.environ.get(\u0026quot;DATABASE_URL\u0026quot;)\rother_variable = os.environ.get(\u0026quot;OTHER_VARIABLE\u0026quot;)\r AWS CLI configuration When using Amazon S3 to store data, a simple method of managing AWS access is to set your access keys to environment variables. However, managing mutiple sets of keys on a single machine (e.g. when working on multiple projects) it is best to use a credentials file, typically located in ~/.aws/credentials. A typical file might look like:\n[default]\raws_access_key_id=myaccesskey\raws_secret_access_key=mysecretkey\r[another_project]\raws_access_key_id=myprojectaccesskey\raws_secret_access_key=myprojectsecretkey\r You can add the profile name when initialising a project; assuming no applicable environment variables are set, the profile credentials will be used be default.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"efd29d0a69e5c510b966ec364d8a971a","permalink":"/en/interesting-reads/keep-secrets-and-configuration-out-of-version-control/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/interesting-reads/keep-secrets-and-configuration-out-of-version-control/","section":"interesting-reads","summary":"Keep secrets and configuration out of version control You really don\u0026rsquo;t want to leak your AWS secret key or Postgres username and password on Github.
